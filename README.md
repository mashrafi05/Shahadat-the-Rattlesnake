Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score and updates as you collect food.
Boundary and Self-Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.
Game Over Screen: Displays a game over message when the game ends.


I named this Snake game "Shahadat the Rattlesnake" after my friend Shahadat because, like a rattlesnake, he's dangerously toxic. ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ
